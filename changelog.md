# Changelog

# 1.0.2 - 2025-10-24

### Changed

* **Criteria Display:** The **normalization logic for breakdown data** (`alternatives_contribution.by_criteria`) has been improved. It now applies a two-step normalization that ensures that:
1. The lowest negative value is correctly mapped to `min` (e.g., **0**).
2. The **sum of normalized values** for each alternative is always equal to the `total sum` (e.g., **100**).

This ensures a better and more consistent display of criteria performance, especially those derived from original data that include negative values.
